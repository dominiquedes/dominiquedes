- 👋 Hi, I’m @dominiquedes
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
    My interests lie in full stack development. I have a love for all parts of website development, I love the idea of visually seeing my work but at the same time I love the idea of knowing that my project runs because of the effort that I put in the backend. Along with that, I love creating random automation apps, I can get very lazy and forget to do other tasks in the day therefore I love the idea of having technology do these tiring and repeptitive tasks for me. An exmaple would be an app I created during the summer that would text me the prices of Ethereum and Solana every hour since I had stock in them and I couldn't check the market at every given moment. I love coding in Python, NextJS, Django, and Express.js. But outside of programming I love soccer! I was in fact on national televsion playing in the U17 Women's Concacaf for Haiti in 2024 scoring a goal and getting an assist, and I plan to participte in the U20s for Haiti in 2025.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
    I am currently learning Java for school, we are diving into other the basics of programming in Java using Greenfoot Java. I do already have the basics of Java down and understand the language in it's entiriy but I want to learn how to execute this knowledge in a code editor. Therefore, I am using my freetime afterschool when I'm not training to learn more and more about Java and make more projects.

    Anything that would make an impact. I love solving problems and I love working with people as driven as me to solve these issues. I also love to collaborate on any automation apps, I love the idea of being able to have on less thing to worry about using technology.
