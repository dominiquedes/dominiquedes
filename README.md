Hi, I’m @dominiquedes

- 👀 I’m interested in ... My interests lie in full-stack development. I love all parts of website development, I love the idea of visually seeing my work, but at the same time, I love knowing that my project runs because of the effort that I put into the backend. Along with that, I love creating random automation apps, I can get very lazy and forget to do other tasks in the day, and I love the idea of having technology do these tiring and repetitive tasks for me. An example would be an app I created during the summer that would text me the prices of Ethereum and Solana every hour since I had stock in them and I couldn't check the market at every given moment. I love coding in Python, NextJS, Django, and Express.js. But outside of programming, I love soccer! I was in fact on national television playing in the U17 Women's Concacaf for Haiti in 2024 scoring a goal and getting an assist, and I plan to participate in the U20s for Haiti in 2025.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I am currently learning Java for school, and we are diving into the basics of programming in Java using Greenfoot Java. I do already have the basics of Java down and understand the language in its entirety but I want to learn how to execute this knowledge in a code editor. Therefore, I am using my free time after school when I'm not training to learn more and more about Java and do more projects.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything that would make an impact. I love solving problems and working with people as driven as me to solve these issues. I also love to collaborate on any automation apps, the beauty of technology lies in the fact that it can complete our everyday tasks for us.
